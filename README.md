# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION:
This project predicts customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset, It applies machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and determine whether a customer is likely to leave a service.

FEATURES:
- Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales numerical features.
- Machine Learning Model: Uses a Random Forest Classifier for prediction.
- Model Evaluation - Includes accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC score.

DATASET:
Source: Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle.

INSTALLATION:
To set up the project, install the required dependencies:

"pip install -r requirements.txt"


HOW TO RUN:
Open and run Customer Churn.ipynb
The notebook preprocesses the data, trains the model, and evaluates performance.
Use the trained model to predict customer churn.

RESULT:
Provides insights into factors affecting churn.
